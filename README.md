Data taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

## Running
For preprocess.R to work, download the data set from the above link, and place diabetic_data.csv in dataset_diabetes/ folder. The R script has no dependencies. Source the script from the folder where this README is located.

Once the data is generated by preprocess.R, run train_randomforest.py to train the model and print importance results. It depends on pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
